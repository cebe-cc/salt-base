# salt-basic

Basic saltstack states to make a minimal server configuration.

## Usage

Add these to your saltstack states:

    git submodule add https://github.com/cebe-cc/salt-basic.git salt/basic
    
The states are independent of their actual location in the state file tree, so you may replace `salt/basic` with a location of your choice.
